= Configure mTLS Authentication for Redpanda in Kubernetes
:description: Enable mTLS on a Redpanda cluster and configure listeners to authenticate clients using the Distinguished Name (DN) in the clients' mTLS (X.509) certificates.

When mTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security) is enabled on a Redpanda cluster, you can configure listeners to authenticate clients based on the Distinguished Name (DN) in their X.509 certificates. mTLS authentication involves extracting a principal identifier from the DN of the client's mTLS certificate. The principal, derived from specific components of the DN, serves as the username or identity for authentication purposes. This method ensures a secure and reliable way of verifying client identities. By configuring Redpanda to authenticate using DNs, you can ensure that only clients with valid and recognized certificates can interact with the cluster.

To enable mTLS authentication, set `authentication_method` to `mtls_identity`. For example, to enable mTLS authentication for the internal Kafka API listener:

[source,yaml]
----
listeners:
  kafka:
    port: 9093
    authenticationMethod: "mtls_identity"
----
