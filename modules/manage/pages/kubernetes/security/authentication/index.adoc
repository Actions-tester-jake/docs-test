Redpanda supports two primary authentication methods: SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) and mTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security). SASL provides a flexible and adaptable framework for implementing various authentication mechanisms, such as username and password validation through SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism). mTLS offers a certificate-based authentication approach, using X.509 certificates for mutual validation between clients and Redpanda brokers.
