= Installing rpk
:description: Redpanda Keeper (rpk) is a single binary application that provides a way to interact with your Redpanda clusters from the command line.

Redpanda Keeper (rpk) is a single binary application that provides a way to interact with your Redpanda clusters from the command line.

You can install `rpk` as part of a bundle that includes `redpanda` (see the link:index.adoc[Install Redpanda] for instructions), or you can install the `rpk` binary separately.

If you are preparing to deploy a BYOC cluster using the Redpanda Cloud UI, for example, you only need to install the `rpk` binary.

NOTE: For a list of all `rpk` commands and their syntax, refer to xref:reference:rpk/index.adoc[rpk documentation].

To install the rpk binary as a standalone application, follow the instructions for your operating system.
