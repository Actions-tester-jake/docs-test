Redpanda Keeper `rpk` is Redpanda's command line interface (CLI) utility.

The `rpk` commands let you configure, manage, and tune Redpanda clusters. They also let you manage topics, groups, and access control lists (ACLs).

The `rpk` commands feature autocompletion, so you that can write the first few letters that uniquely identify a command and then use the tab key to complete it. For more information, see xref:./rpk-generate/rpk-generate-shell-completion.adoc[rpk autocompletion documentation].

This section lists the `rpk` commands in alphabetical order. Each command includes a table of flags and their descriptions. You can also get descriptions for each command flag by running `rpk <command> -â€“help` in your locally installed Redpanda.
