= rpk cluster self-test start
:description: Reference for the 'rpk cluster self-test start' command. Starts one or more benchmark tests on one or more nodes of the cluster.
:rpk_version: v23.1.6 (rev cc47e1ad1)

Starts one or more benchmark tests on one or more nodes of the cluster.

Available tests to run:

* *Disk tests*
 ** Throughput test: 512 KB messages, sequential read/write
  *** Uses a larger request message sizes and deeper I/O queue depth to write/read more bytes in a shorter amount of time, at the cost of IOPS/latency.
 ** Latency test: 4 KB messages, sequential read/write
  *** Uses smaller request message sizes and lower levels of parallelism to achieve higher IOPS and lower latency.
* *Network tests*
 ** Throughput test: 8192-bit messages
  *** Unique pairs of Redpanda nodes each act as a client and a server.
  *** The test pushes as much data over the wire, within the test parameters.

This command immediately returns on success, and the tests run asynchronously. The
user polls for results with the xref:./rpk-cluster-self-test-status.adoc[rpk cluster self-test status]
command.

|*Value* |*Type* |*Description*

|-h, --help |- |Help for start.

|--disk-duration-ms |uint |The duration, in milliseconds, of one run of
a disk benchmark test (default: 5000).

|--network-duration-ms |uint |The duration, in milliseconds, of one run
of a network benchmark test (default: 5000).

|--no-confirm |- |Acknowledge warning prompt skipping read from stdin.

|--only-disk-test |- |Runs only the disk benchmarks.

|--only-network-test |- |Runs only network benchmarks.

|--participant-node-ids |ints |IDs of nodes that the benchmark tests
will run on. If not set, tests will be run on all nodes.

|--admin-api-tls-cert |string |The certificate to be used for TLS
authentication with the Admin API.

|--admin-api-tls-enabled |- |Enable TLS for the Admin API (not necessary

communication with the Admin API.

|--api-urls |string |Comma-separated list of Admin API addresses
(\|IP\|:\|port\|).

|--brokers |strings a|
Comma-separated list of broker ip:port pairs. For example:

|--sasl-mechanism |string |The authentication mechanism to use.
Supported values: SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-512.

|--tls-cert |string |The certificate to be used for TLS authentication
with the broker.

|--tls-truststore |string |The truststore to be used for TLS
communication with the broker.

|--user |string |SASL user to be used for authentication.

|-v, --verbose |- |Enable verbose logging (default: false).

=== Example output

 $ rpk cluster self-test start
 ? Redpanda self-test will run benchmarks of disk and network hardware that will consume significant system resources. Do not start self-test if large workloads are already running on the system. (Y/n)
 Redpanda self-test has started, test identifier: "031be460-246b-46af-98f2-5fc16f03aed3", To check the status run:
    rpk cluster self-test status
