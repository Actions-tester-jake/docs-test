= rpk iotune
:description: This command measures the I/O performance of the hardware used by a Redpanda instance.

`rpk iotune` measures the I/O performance of the hardware used by a Redpanda instance and writes its parameters to an I/O configuration file that Redpanda reads on startup to optimize its I/O performance. Its benchmarks measure read/write IOPS and bandwidth.

By default `rpk iotune` writes its output parameters to `/etc/redpanda/io-config.yaml`.
