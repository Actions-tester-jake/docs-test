:description: rpk redpanda tune (autotuner)
:page-aliases: reference:autotune.adoc, introduction:autotune.adoc

`rpk redpanda tune`, also referred to as the autotuner, identifies the hardware configuration on your machine and optimizes the Linux kernel to give you the best performance for running Redpanda.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You should run the autotuner as part of the production deployment workflow. Redpanda recommends you first follow a guide for production deployment:

* xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/manual/production/production-deployment.adoc[Deploy for Production]
* xref:deploy:deployment-option/self-hosted/kubernetes/kubernetes-tune-workers.adoc[Tune Kubernetes Worker Nodes for Production]

While you follow the guides, consult this reference for details about the autotuner.

== Usage

----
rpk redpanda tune <list of elements to tune> [command] [flags]
----

[TIP]
====
* When running `rpk redpanda tune`, make sure that your current Linux user has root privileges. The autotuner requires privileged access to the Linux kernel settings.
* To run `rpk redpanda tune all` on a Redpanda broker automatically after broker or host restarts, configure the service `redpanda-tuner`, which runs `rpk redpanda tune all`, to run at boot-up:
 ** For RHEL, after installing the rpm package, run `systemctl` to both start and enable the `redpanda-tuner` service:
+
[,bash]
----
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner
sudo systemctl enable redpanda-tuner
----

** For Ubuntu, after installing the apt package, run `systemctl` to start the `redpanda-tuner` service (which is already enabled):
+
[,bash]
----
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner
----

== Flags

|===
|*Value* |*Type* |*Description*

|--config |string |Redpanda config file, if not set the file will be
searched for in the default locations.

|-r, --dirs |strings |List of *data* directories or places to store
data, for example: `/var/vectorized/redpanda/`, usually your XFS
filesystem on an NVMe SSD device.

|-d, --disks |strings |Lists of devices to tune for example `sda1`.

|-h, --help |- a|
Help for tune.

Get a help description for a specific tuner:

`rpk redpanda tune help <tuner>`

|-m, --mode |string a|
Operation Mode: one of: [`sq`, `sq_split`,\{" "} `mq`]

* `sq`: set all IRQs of a given device to CPU0
* `sq_split`: divide all IRQs of a given device between CPU0 and its HT
siblings
* `mq`: distribute device IRQs among all available CPUs instead of
binding them all to CPU0

|-n, --nic |strings |Network Interface Controllers to tune.

|--output-script |string |If set tuners will generate tuning file that
can later be used to tune the system.

|--reboot-allowed |- |If set will allow tuners to tune boot parameters
and request system reboot.

|--timeout |duration |The maximum time to wait for the tune processes to
complete. The value passed is a sequence of decimal numbers, each with
optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `1.5s` or\{" "}
`2h45m`. Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `Âµs`), `ms`, ` s `, `m`,
`h` (default 10s)

|-v, --verbose |- |Enable verbose logging (default `false`).

=== Examples

This section provides examples of using the autotuner.

* To enable a predetermined set of tuners for production, run the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-mode.adoc[rpk redpanda mode prod] command. This command modifies settings in the `redpanda.yaml` configuration file.
* To list the available tuners and to see whether they're enabled or supported (and a reason for if they're unsupported), run the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-tune-list.adoc[rpk redpanda tune list] command.
* To enable or disable a tuner, run the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-config-set.adoc[rpk redpanda config set], as the tuner flags are configurable node properties.
** Each tuner has a YAML key flag for enabling/disabling itself in `redpanda.yaml`. Most are formed by prepending `rpk.tune_` to the name of the tuner listed by xref:reference:rpk/rpk-redpanda/rpk-redpanda-tune-list.adoc[rpk redpanda tune list]. See the xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune-list.adoc#tuners[Tuners reference] for the exact key for a tuner. For an example of enabling a tuner, the key for the `aio_events` tuner is `rpk.tune_aio_events`, and it can be enabled with the following command:
+
----
rpk redpanda config set rpk.tune_aio_events true
----
* To run all available tuners, use the xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune.adoc[rpk redpanda tune] command for `all`:
+
----
rpk redpanda tune all
----

* To run a specific tuner, use the xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune.adoc[rpk redpanda tune] command for the tuner:
+
----
rpk redpanda tune <tuner>
----

* To learn more about a tuner, use the xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune.adoc[rpk redpanda tune help] command for the tuner:
+
----
rpk redpanda tune help <tuner>
----
+
See also the xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune-list.adoc#tuners[Tuners reference] for descriptions about each tuner.
