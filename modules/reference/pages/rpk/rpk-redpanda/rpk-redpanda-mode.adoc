= rpk redpanda mode
:description: rpk redpanda mode. Enables a default development or production configuration mode for Redpanda.

Enable a default configuration mode. This command changes the local `redpanda.yaml` and enable or disable the tuners based on each mode. For example `prod` enables multiple tuners whereas mode `dev` disable all tuners.

The available modes:

* <<development-mode,Development mode>>
* <<production-mode,Production mode>>
* <<usage,Usage>>
* <<flags,Flags>>

'''

== Development mode

Development (dev) mode includes the following development-only settings:

* Sets `developer_mode` to `true`. This starts Redpanda with dev-mode only settings, including:
** No minimal memory limits are enforced.
** No core assignment rules for Redpanda nodes are enforced.
** Bypasses `fsync` (from https://docs.seastar.io/master/structseastar_1_1reactor%5F%5Foptions.html#ad66cb23f59ed5dfa8be8189313988692[Seastar option `unsafe_bypass_fsync`^]), which results in unrealistically fast clusters and may result in data loss.
* Sets `overprovisioned` to `true`. Redpanda expects a dev system to be an overprovisioned environment. Based on a https://docs.seastar.io/master/structseastar_1_1reactor%5F%5Foptions.html#a0caf6c2ad579b8c22e1352d796ec3c1d[Seastar option^], setting `overprovisioned` disables thread affinity, zeros idle polling time, and disables busy-poll for disk I/O.
* Sets all autotuner xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune-list.adoc#tuners[tuners] to `false`. The tuners are intended to run only for production mode.

== Production mode

Production (prod) mode disables dev-mode settings:

* `developer_mode: false`
* `overprovisioned: false`

It also enables a set of tuners of the autotuner. For descriptions about the tuners, see xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune-list.adoc#tuners[Tuners] in the xref:./rpk-redpanda-tune-list.adoc[rpk redpanda tune list] command reference.
