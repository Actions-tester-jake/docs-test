= Node Configuration Properties
:description: Node configuration properties list.

Node configuration properties are applied individually to each node in a cluster. The following table lists each node configuration property in alphabetical order, along with its description and default setting.

IMPORTANT: After you change a node-level property setting, you must restart the node for the change to take effect.

== Required properties

NOTE: You must include the following required properties in your configuration. If you omit them, `redpanda` will not start.

|===
| Property | Description

| data_directory
| The folder where Redpanda streaming data files are stored.


| node_id
| A number that identifies the node within the cluster. This value can be assigned automatically by a deployment tool, or it can be assigned by the user. Each node must have a unique `node_id`, and nodes should be numbered in sequence. This property must not be changed once a node joins a cluster.
