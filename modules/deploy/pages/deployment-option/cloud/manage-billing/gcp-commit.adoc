= Use with GCP Commitment
:description: Subscribe to Redpanda in Google Cloud Marketplace with discounted commitment billing.

Subscribe to Redpanda through Google Cloud Marketplace to quickly provision Dedicated Cloud clusters. With a usage-based billing commitment, you sign up for a minimum spend amount and get a discount on your committed usage. 

Commitments are minimums. If you use more than your committed amount, you can continue using Redpanda Cloud without interruption. You will be charged at your discounted rate for usage beyond the committed amount until the end of your commitment term.
