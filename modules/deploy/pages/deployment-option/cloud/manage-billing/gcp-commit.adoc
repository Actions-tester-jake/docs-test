= Use GCP Commits
:description: Subscribe to Redpanda in Google Cloud Marketplace with discounted commitment billing.

With a usage-based billing commitment, you sign up for a minimum spend amount and get a discount on your committed usage. This allows you to subscribe to Redpanda Cloud through Google Cloud Marketplace to quickly provision Redpanda Dedicated clusters. 

Commitments are minimums: 

- If your usage is below your commitment, you still pay the minimum, but the unused amount at the end of your commitment term can roll over. 
- If your usage is above your commitment, you can continue using Redpanda Cloud without interruption. You are charged at your discounted rate for additional usage until the end of your commitment term.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you subscribe to Redpanda Cloud through Google Cloud Marketplace, you can only create clusters on GCP.
