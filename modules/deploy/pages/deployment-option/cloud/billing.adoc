=== Storage pricing

Redpanda Cloud charges for the volume of data stored on a cluster, including replication. Replication is important for high availability. Because Redpanda Cloud has a default replication factor of three, the amount of data stored typically exceeds the volume of data written to the cluster. To reduce storage usage, you can configure the `retention.bytes` and `retention.ms` on a topic. 

* Each storage unit = 1 GB data in cloud storage/hour. 
* The cost for 1 unit of cloud storage is $0.000000000007937/unit.
