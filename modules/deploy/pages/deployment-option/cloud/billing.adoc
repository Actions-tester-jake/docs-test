== Redpanda consumption units

Redpanda Cloud pricing is mapped to the consumption of resources in your organization. To calculate the bill, the number of units consumed is multiplied by the cost for that unit. All prices are in US dollars (USD).

=== Instance pricing

* Each instance unit = 1 hour the instance is up. 
* The cost for an instance unit depends on the region and tier you selected for your Dedicated cluster.

=== Storage pricing

Redpanda Cloud charges for the volume of data stored on a cluster, including replication. Replication is important for high availability. Because Redpanda Cloud has a default replication factor of three, the amount of data stored typically exceeds the volume of data written to the cluster. To reduce storage usage, you can configure the `retention.bytes` and `retention.ms` on a topic. 

* Each storage unit = 1 GB data in cloud storage per hour. 
* The cost for 1 unit of cloud storage is $0.00007937 per GB per hour.
