This branch contains content that is intended to be shared across all component versions.

== Global attributes

The attributes in the `ROOT/partials/attributes.yaml` file are merged into the `antora.yml` file of each component version by the {url-extensions}[global attributes extension]. These global attributes are required for all local builds as well as the production build.

== Terms

The pages in the `terms/partials/` directory are terms that can be referenced in any component version using the {url-extensions}[`glossterm` macro]. The content of these term pages are also added automatically to `reference:glossary.adoc` pages by the {url-extensions}[aggregate terms extension].

Each partial file in the `terms/partials/` directory is a term. Each file must include the following attributes:

- `term-name`: The name of the term.
- `hover-text`: A short definition of the term to be used as hover-over text.

If a page called `reference:glossary.adoc` exists in a component version, the contents of each term file gets merged into the glossary during the build. Terms are merged in alphabetical order, according to the filename.
